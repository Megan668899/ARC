Instructions to encode and decode all 14 sequences with 14x4 = 56 QPs

/******************************************************************
1. Running an experiment
2. Extracting the experiment result data after the run
3. Modifying the dataset (test sequences) folder path in the batch file before running the experiment
/******************************************************************

1. Running an experiment
Copy the generated executable to X:\Experimental_Platform_14seq_AVS\01 or X:\Experimental_Platform_14seq_HEVC\01  //Copy the executable to the experimental platform
Open a "Command Prompt" window
cd X:\Experimental_Platform_14seq_AVS\01 or X:\Experimental_Platform_14seq_HEVC\01  //Go to the folder where the experimental platform is located
Run copy_exe.bat                      //copy the executable files to each window.
Run run_all.bat                      //open the windows with serial numbers 01-18

/******************************************************************

2. Extracting the experiment result data after the run
Take extracting AI data as an example
Open a "Command Prompt" window
cd X:\Experimental_Platform_14seq_AVS\ai_rexInfo or X:\Experimental_Platform_14seq_HEVC\ai_rexInfo  //Go to the directory where the experimental platform is located
Run extract_file.bat ai
cd X:\Experimental_Platform_14seq_AVS\ai_rexInfo or Experimental_Platform_14seq_HEVC\ai_rexInfo  //Go to the directory where the experimental platform is located
Run rExInfo.bat ai
Open the ai file
The data in ExtractPSNR.txt, ExtractEnTime.txt, and ExtractDeTime.txt are PSNR, encoding time, and decoding time respectively.

/******************************************************************

3. Modifying the dataset (test sequemces) folder path in the batch file before running the experiment
The current directory where the datasets for the 14 AVSs in the Experimental_Platform_14seq_AVS file are stored is: D:\seq\AVS3_SCC_8bit_420
Open oneqp.bat to modify the dataset directory  //set seqpath=D:\seq\AVS3_SCC_8bit_420
Then copy the modified oneqp.bat file to X:\Experimental_Platform_14seq_AVS\01
Open a "Command Prompt" window
cd X:\Experimental_Platform_14seq_AVS\01
Run copy_qp.bat //Copy the oneqp.bat file with the modified path to each window
